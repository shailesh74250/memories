Some concept -
- Backend server only run when mongodb gets connected successfully
- We can defined size of data going to be transfer via network or through api
    - app.use(express.json({ limit: '30mb', extended: true }))
    - app.use(express.urlencoded({ limit: '30mb', extended: true }))
- Now no need to use body parser, its deprecated 
- No need to pass extra parameter during mongodb connection (but it only work in mongoose updated version)
